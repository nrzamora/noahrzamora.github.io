    <h1>Welcome to Noah Zamora's Resume!</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>I'm a Junior at UCI from San Diego, California, and I'm a member of our Division 1 tennis program. I come from a family of two sisters and an older brother, and two loving parents! I'm currently majoring in Business Economics, along with a minor in Digital Informatics, and I love what I do! In my free time, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors, whether that be hiking with friends, basking around at the beach, or camping in the wilderness for days on end. When I feel like staying in, I love reading financial literature, cleaning up around my apartment, or watching anime. On the topic of "anime," I'll always be the biggest fan of Pokemon, as it has been my show ever since I was 6 years old. In the future, I'd love to try out a life on the professional tennis circuit, but if that doesn't work out, I'd want to go into Law School to become a potential Corporate Lawyer! I've always wanted to be as ambitious as I could, since life is too short to not try living it to the fullest. I hope you all enjoyed this minute autobiography!</p>
        <h2 class="bold">My Favorite Foods!</h2>
        <p>I enjoy all types of fruits, but I absolutely despise vegetables. I love anything Greek or Mediterranean, and I would kill for any type of panini. I've got a wide range of foods I really like, so I'm anything but picky!</p>
        <h2 class="bold">My Tennis Career</h2>
        <p>I started playing the sport of tennis since I was 5 years old. That's right, I simultaneously learned how to read and play tennis! I started to play competitively around 9 years old, and I won the first four tournaments I entered, so I started off with a bang! Throughout my teenage years, I played on the national level, winning many big tournaments along the way. I traveled across the country participating in these tournaments, competing against the best tennis players in the USA that are my age! After competing the junior circuit at the age of 18, I committed to play college tennis for UCI, and I've earned multiple honors for my play, including helping the team win the Big West Conference my freshman year! Currently, I'm in my third year competing for the Anteaters, and I'm having the time of my life!</p>
        <h2 class="bold">My Working Experience!</h2>
        <p>Since I spent most of my adolescent years training to be the best tennis player I could be, I never had exposure in the job market. Consequently, I'm quite new to working any sort of job, but that won't deter me from any challenge that would be thrown my way. However, I've "worked" as a tennis coach to the younger children around my neighborhood, and I found it extremely fun and meaningful. I'm positive I can apply the traits I exercised in my tenure as a tennis coach: my aptitude, resilience, and interpersonal skills!</p>
